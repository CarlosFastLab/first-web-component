# First Web Component
A basic web component created following the Udemy course:<br>
[Web Components & Stencil.js - Build Custom HTML Elements](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-components-stenciljs-build-custom-html-elements).<br>
This web component is basically a simple tooltip, without much styling, as a means to practice.<br>
The component's class extends HTMLElement and future implementation will be based on a extending Built-In elements.
